# EXPT.NO.8-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-GO-BACK-N-PROTOCOL-SELECTIVE-REPEAT

# AIM:

To write and execute a program for Go-Back-N protocol-Selective Repeat.

# EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:

Personal Computer Turbo C Compiler

# PROCEDURE:

1.	Connect two computers in Wired/Wireless LAN.
   
2.	Make sure that two computers are in one network and could able to ping each other.	In the codeblocker open new c file and type the program.
    
3.	In the menu choose->Project->Properties->Project Build options->Linker settings->Add netproto and pthread.
    
4.	Execute the program in both server and client.
    
5.	Enter the IP address of the remote machine, port address of both local & remote machine and error rate.
    
6.	Choose the file and verify the go back protocol operation.

# PROGRAM:

#include<stdio.h> void main()

{

int i,j,n;

printf("GO BACK N ARQ\n");

//printf("Entermessage in format\n"); printf("Enter number of frame : "); scanf("%d",&n);

char frame[n][10];

for(i=1;i<=n;i++)

{

printf("Content for frame %d :",i); scanf("%s",&frame[i]);

}

int s=1;

//while(j<=n){

printf("Enter frame number with no ACK :"); scanf("%d",&j);

for(i=1;i<=n;i++)

{

if(i!=j)

printf("\n Sending frame %d \n FRAME ACKNOWLEDGED.	\n",i);

//else

//printf("\n Frame not Acknowledeged.	\n");
 
}

if(j<=n)

{

printf("No Acknowlegement for frame %d... \n",j); printf("Resending... Content from frame %d :%s\n\n",j,frame[j]);

}

printf("\n Sending frame %d \n FRAME ACKNOWLEDGED.	\n",j);

//}

printf("\n\nALL FRAME RECIEVED SUCCESSFULLY\n\n");

}

# OUTPUT:

![Selective repeat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa655b3-56c4-454a-b534-044bad6827c2)

# RESULT:
Thus the Go-Back-N protocol- Selective Repeat was implemented and the output is verified successfully.
